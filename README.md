I'd love to build an app to help announce lost items found around campus. The issue I see is that when a lost item is found on campus, the person who tries to post about the item online is limited to whatever social media they use such as twitter, snapchat, instagram, etc. That's why I want to make a app for our campus where it's easy to post and announce lost items. It'd have a bulleten board with posts that first show lost item, a picture of it, the name of the person who found it, their student email and finally the time it was found. Ideally on the front page it would also have ways to filter out the posts based on time item was found and general location. When clicking on the post, it would be nice to reveal some more details like how to contact the user who found the item, a small description of what the user found and when they're available to meet up.
